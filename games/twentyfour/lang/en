You will be shown four random digits from 1 to 9.  

Using all four digits just once, and any combination of plus (+) minus (-)
multiplication (*) and division (/), you must create an expression which
evaluates to the number 24.

The expression must use 'RPN' (Reverse Polish Notation), which means
that instead of adding one and two like this: '1 + 2',  you do it like
this: '1 2 +'.  For example, given the digits '1 1 3 6', the expression '6 3 1 + 1
* *' will work. You may not combine digits.

If the expression is correct, you gain two points; if it is incorrect, you lose
one point.  If you press 'Skip' then you neither gain nor lose points. In any case,
you will be given another set of digits to try.

Your goal is to get 10 points in 5 minutes.

Good luck!",
