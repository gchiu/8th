\ 8th normally allows you to override existing words.  If you don't like that
\ behavior, you can do something different by assigning an action to "conflict"

\ let's define a word:
: joe "Hi, Joe!\n" . ;

\ show that we can redefine it without problems:

: joe "Bye, Joe!\n" . ;

joe

\ Now put a handler in place
(
	"You are trying to override '" .
	.
	"', which will be disallowed\n" .
	false
) is conflict

\ and try to override again

: joe "Success is ours, Joe!\n" . ;

joe

bye
