quote * Example of what 'late binding' does:

The following word 'l+' uses '+' in a late-bound mode.  So the precise '+' word
to use is determined at run-time, as if it were entered then in the REPL:
* . cr

: l+ l: + ;

"Give it two numbers:\n" .
123 321 l+ . cr

"Now give it two strings:\n" .
"cat in the " "hat" l+ . cr
