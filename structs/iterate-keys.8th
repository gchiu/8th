\ How to iterate an map in order of keys

{
	"xyz" : "last",
	"abcd" : "first",
	"mnop" : "middle"
} var, o

"This is how the map is iterated in its natural order.\n" .
"Note that in general, the last key inserted is the first key retrieved:\n" .

o @ ( . cr drop ) m:each drop cr


"And this is how the map is iterated in sorted key order:\n" .

o @ m:keys ' s:cmp a:sort
\ o sorted-keys
( nip m:@ . cr ) a:each drop drop

bye
