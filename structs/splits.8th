\ Splitting a string for fun and profit

"He went to the store"

\ show it:
dup . cr

\ split the string on spaces:
\ NOTe: could also have been done with Regex
" " s:/

\ now show the array you made:
dup . cr

\ and let's change "store" to "bar"
dup >r
r@ 4 "bar" a:!

\ show the new array:
r@ . cr

\ and let's coalesce it:
r> ( swap " " s:+  s:+ ) "" a:reduce

\ the final result is:
dup . cr

bye
