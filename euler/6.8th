\ Euler problem #6
\ The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
\ 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
\ The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
\ 
\ (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
\ Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
\ 
\ Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

with: n
: sqr-sum-n  \ n -- sqr(sum(n...1))
	dup 1+ * 2 / int sqr ;

: sum-squares \ n -- sum(n^2)
	0 swap	\ accumulate the sum here
	( sqr + ) swap 1 swap loop ;

100 dup sqr-sum-n swap sum-squares - . cr bye
