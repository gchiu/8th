\ Use of "local variables"

locals: 
: bar 
  "baz" w:!
  "in bar, baz is: " .  "baz" w:@ . cr ;
 
\ Interestingly, a word which doesn't "have locals" which is called from one
\ which does, can access the calling word's locals:
: internal
  200 "baz" w:! ;

locals: 
: foo 
  dup "baz" w:!
  "baz" w:@ n:1- 
  locals: (
    "baz" w:!
    internal
    "in anon, baz is: " . "baz" w:@ . cr
  ) w:exec
  10 bar
  "in foo, baz is: " .  "baz" w:@ . cr ;


3 foo
