\ Convert a randomly large buffer of bytes to the equivalent number

: b:>n \ b -- n
  0  swap
  (
    nip
    swap 256 n:* n:+
  ) b:each ;

\ Test it by creating a large buffer:
80 randbuf var, testbuf

\ and dumping it so we see what's inside:

testbuf @ dump cr

\ then converting to a number and printing as hex:

testbuf @ b:>n hex . cr 

bye
